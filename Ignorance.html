            <h2><u>IGNORANCE</u></h2>
            Man has been a subject to ignorance for eons <br>
            And his ignorance is more often driven by his vanity.<br>
            Everyone tries to be superior to the other<br>
            And this desire is the root cause of all disdain.<br>
            Our material pursuits<br>
            Make it overwhelmingly difficult<br>
            To realise the true essence of life.<br>
            We fail to contemplate upon our actions<br>
            And end up in our foolish pretensions<br>
            Of worldly possessions.<br>
            This world of illusions<br>
            And wretched deceptions,<br>
            Compel our innocent souls<br>
            To enter upon several delusions<br>
            And get entangled in this web<br>
            Of desire and consequential vicious cycle.<br>
            We tend to ignore the very voice<br>
            Of our beneficent conscience.<br>
            Silence follows the benignant beckoning.<br>
            The silence denotes the very presence<br>
            Of an ignorant self and self-proclaimed notions<br>
            About one’s thoughts, ideas and emotions.<br>
            The husky fiend shrouds the truth<br>
            And enters upon as a friend<br>
            To play gimmickry with our ignorant self.<br>
            But your inner soul doesn’t leave you<br>
            It still resides within you.<br>
            It just waits for the right occasions<br>
            To ring the bell and warn you.<br>
            But the spright is a better friend now<br>
            And you keep ignoring the harsh beckoning.<br>
            But some day or the other,<br>
            You will unravel the truth.<br>
            But it’ll be too late for you<br>
            To dispense with<br>
            The services of ignorance.<br>
            So, awake my friend<br>
            And awake thy soul,<br>
            To see the truth and embrace it.<br>
