                <h2><u>Troubles</u></h2>
                Whatâ€™s there in life if troubles donâ€™t trouble you much?<br>
                Because troubles help you identify your true potential.<br>
                Because troubles help you know your friends better.<br>
                Because troubles enable you to distinguish between truth and illusion.<br>
                Because troubles push you to your limits<br>
                And make you realise that you are limitless,<br>
                Your opportunities are limitless,<br>
                Your hopes are limitless,<br>
                Your capacity is unfathomable,<br>
                Your reach is infinite,<br>
                Your life itself is unbound<br>
                Despite all the odds that challenge you,<br>
                Despite all the anxieties that worry you,<br>
                Despite all the misfortunes that disfigure you,<br>
                Despite all the troubles that limit you,<br>
                Because troubles pull you out of your comfort zone<br>
                And help you stand out successful in this limitless crowd.<br>
                So, stop being afraid of these troubles<br>
                Stop being threatened by the challenges that life throws upon you.<br>
                Stop being a coward who fears failures.<br>
                Be a hero and realise your failures.<br>
                Strengthen yourself and improve upon your weaknesses.<br>
                Have a zeal to succeed,<br>
                Have faith to excel,<br>
                And have the intention to defeat yourself.<br>
