            <p>
                The day started out pretty sunny but gradually became cloudy and dark. <br>
                The day was usual for Vivek. Wake up early, have his breakfast, finish <br>
                his assignments, if he has any, have a chat with his friend Manu over<br>
                phone and finally settle down doing nothing. The lockdown came down <br>
                quite heavily on Vivek and his friends as they had nothing much to do <br>
                and they couldn’t meet each other either.  COVID-19 was certainly a <br>
                bane for them and more wretched were the social distancing norms that <br>
                prevented them from meeting up. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                But Vivek was a tad more fortunate as his father ran a small restaurant <br>
                in the city and he used to take Vivek with him. However, there was a caveat <br>
                to this seemingly fabulous plan. Vivek was just allowed to step out of <br>
                his house and not out of the small restaurant. Alas! No soul can actually <br>
                condole with him. He has to sit at the counter with a mask on and that <br>
                too for many hours while his father was away completing the deliveries. <br>
                It was even more boring and painstaking for him to do this. But he didn’t <br>
                have a choice as his mom was sick and couldn’t do the job. <br>
